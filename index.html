                    of the lower lid.[1][2] Most of the computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid
                    enclosure
                    under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen,

                    Laptops can run on both AC power and rechargable battery packs and can be folded shut for convenient
                    storage and
